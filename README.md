### Background

As National University students studying Information Systems in the Computer Science Engineering program, our capstone project was to create a website. Upon deciding what type of site to design, registries seemed to fit each of our lives in some sort of way. As we discussed the pros and cons of the existing market, there were a number of discrepancies or  missing accommodations, we felt there was a niche that could be better fulfilled to meet the customer's needs. Together, through hard work and dedication Teeng.org was created. The idea behind Teeng is simple: a lifetime family gift registry you can set up once and use forever to give and get the gifts that matter most. Because there is always something to celebrate - holidays, birthdays, weddings, graduation, new babies, new homes or just because, Teeng is the place to share gift ideas with family and friends online or on the go. Teeng is your personal, year-round registry.
